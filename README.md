# TheGamingRoom

## Question One
The Gaming Room was a software project in which we had to design a game service, which could contain multiple games, which would have multiple teams, which would have mulitple players. A major component in this was ensuring everything has a unique ID, which was incremented with every item's creation, ensuring no true repeat instances. In addition, the company wanted us to decide the platform their servers would be based upon.

## Question Two
In my opinion, the design constraints and the domain model are the parts where I did best in this document.

## Question Three
I found the domain model to be the most useful when developing code. It actually helped me decipher the proper relationships between all the systems within the project.

## Question Four
If I could rework one part of the project, it would definitely be the entire section done in Project Three. Of all the sections, I feel like I had the worst understanding of everything going on with the content in this section.

## Question Five
The way I considered the user's needs was by making the software available to as many users as possible by making it as unintensive on user systems as possible. It's important to ensure your product is accessible to users, to ensure there actually is a market for what you develop.

## Question Six
My approach to developing the software was very 'by the book', sticking close to the solutions provided by our textbooks. In the future, I would work to find more efficient and flexible solutions, especially those that may suit the problem better.
